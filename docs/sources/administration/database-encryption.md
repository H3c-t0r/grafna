# Grafana database encryption

Grafanaâ€™s database contains secrets, which are used to query data sources, send alert notifications and perform other functions within Grafana.

Grafana encrypts these secrets before they are written to the database, by using a symmetric-key encryption algorithm called Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and using a [secret key]({{< relref "../administration/configuration/#secret_key" >}}) that you can change when you configure a new Grafana instance.

Since Grafana v9.0, it uses [envelope encryption](#envelope-encryption) by default, which adds a layer of indirection to the
encryption process that represents an [**implicit breaking change**](#implicit-breaking-change) for older versions of Grafana.

For further details about how to operate a Grafana instance with envelope encryption, see the [Operational work](#operational work) section below.

> **Note:** In Grafana Enterprise, you can also choose to [encrypt secrets in AES-GCM mode]({{< relref "../enterprise/enterprise-encryption/#changing-your-encryption-mode-to-aes-gcm" >}}) instead of AES-CFB.

# Envelope encryption

> **Note:** Since Grafana v9.0, you can turn it off by adding the term `disableEnvelopeEncryption` to the list of
> feature toggles in your [Grafana configuration]({{< relref "../administration/configuration/#feature_toggles" >}}).

Instead of encrypting all secrets with a single key, Grafana uses a set of keys called data encryption keys (DEKs) to
encrypt them. These data encryption keys are themselves encrypted with a single key encryption key (KEK), configured
through the `secret_key` attribute in your
[Grafana configuration]({{< relref "../administration/configuration/#secret_key" >}}) or with a
[KMS integration](#kms-integration).

## Implicit breaking change

As stated above, envelope encryption represents an implicit breaking change because it changes the way secrets stored
into the Grafana database are encrypted. That means Grafana administrators will be able to transition to Grafana v9.0
with no action required from the database encryption perspective, but will need to be extremely careful if they need
to roll back to a previous version (e.g. Grafana v8.5) after being updated, because secrets created or modified after
the update to Grafana v9.0 won't be decryptable on previous versions.

Fortunately though, envelope encryption was added since Grafana v8.3 behind a feature toggle. So, in case of emergency,
Grafana administrators will be able to downgrade up to Grafana v8.3 and enable envelope encryption as a workaround.

> **Note:** In Grafana releases between v8.3 and v8.5, you can turn on envelope encryption on by adding the term
> `envelopeEncryption` to the list of feature toggles in your
> [Grafana configuration]({{< relref "../administration/configuration/#feature_toggles" >}}).

# Operational work

From the database encryption perspective, there are several operations that a Grafana administrator may want to perform:

- [**Re-encrypt secrets**](#re-encrypt-secrets): Enables a user to use APIs at the broadest, most powerful administrative level.
- [**Roll back secrets**](#roll-back-secrets): Enables a user to use APIs at the broadest, most powerful administrative level.
- [**Re-encrypt data keys**](#re-encrypt-data-keys): Enables a user to use APIs at the broadest, most powerful administrative level.
- [**Rotate data keys**](#rotate-data-keys): Enables a user to use APIs at the broadest, most powerful administrative level.

# KMS integration

With KMS integrations, you can choose to encrypt secrets stored in the Grafana database using a key from a KMS, which is a secure central storage location that is designed to help you to create and manage cryptographic keys and control their use across many services.

> **Note:** KMS integration is available in Grafana Enterprise. For more information, refer to [Enterprise Encryption]({{< relref "../enterprise/enterprise-encryption/_index.md" >}}) in Grafana Enterprise.
