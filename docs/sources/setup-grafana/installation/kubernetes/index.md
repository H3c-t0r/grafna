# Deploy Grafana on Kubernetes

This page explains how to install and run Grafana on Kubernetes (K8s). It uses Kubernetes manifests for the setup. If you prefer Helm, refer to the [Grafana Helm community charts](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts).

## Before you begin

To follow this guide, you need:

- The latest version of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) running either locally or remotely (on a public or private cloud).

- To use in a local environment use any Kubernetes such as [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/), and so on.

- To use managed cloud services such as [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), or [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/) if you are considering using Kubernetes in a production environment.

## System Requirements

This section provides minimum hardware and software requirements.

### Minimum Hardware Requirements

- Disk Space = 1 GB
- Memory = 750 MiB (approx 750 MB)
- CPU = 250m (approx 2.5 cores)

### Supported databases

For a list of supported databases, refer to [supported databases](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/#supported-databases).

### Supported web browsers

For a list of support web browsers, refer to [supported web browsers](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/#supported-web-browsers).

> **Note:** Make sure to enable port `3000` in your network environment as this is the Grafana default port.

## Deploy Grafana OSS on Kubernetes

This section explains how to install Grafana OSS using Kubernetes. If you want to install Grafana Enterprise on Kubernetes,Â  refer to [Deploy Grafana Enterprise on Kubernetes](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/kubernetes/#deploy-grafana-enterprise-on-kubernetes).

When you deploy an application in Kubernetes, it will use its default namespace which may have other applications running and can cause conflicts and other issues.

As best practice, create a new namespace, as Kubernetes does allow users to create namespaces which will allow us to easily manage,Â  organize, allocate, and manage cluster resources. Refer to the Kubernetes official documentation for more reference about the [Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).

1. To create a namespace, run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace my-grafana
   ```
   In this example, the namespace is `my-grafana`

1. To verify and view the newly created namespace, run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl get namespace my-grafana
   ```
   The output of the above command will provide more information about the newly created namespace.

1. Create a file called `grafana.yaml`. This file will contain the YAML code aka manifest for deploying Grafana.
   
   ```bash
   touch grafana.yaml
   ```

    In the next step you define the following three objects in the YAML file.

    | Object | Description |
    | ------ | ------ |
    | Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) | This object stores the data. |
    | Service | This object provides network access to the Pod defined in the deployment. |
    | Deployment | This object is responsible for creating the pods, ensuring they stay up to date, and  managing Replicaset and Rolling updates. |

1. Copy and paste the following contents and save it in the `grafana.yaml` file.
   
   ```yaml
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: grafana-pvc
   spec:
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 1Gi
   ---
   apiVersion: apps/v1

           supplementalGroups:
             - 0
         containers:
           - name: grafana
             image: grafana/grafana:latest
             imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
             ports:
               - containerPort: 3000

                 scheme: HTTP
               initialDelaySeconds: 10
               periodSeconds: 30
               successThreshold: 1
               timeoutSeconds: 2
             livenessProbe:
               failureThreshold: 3
               initialDelaySeconds: 30
               periodSeconds: 10
               successThreshold: 1
               tcpSocket:
                 port: 3000
               timeoutSeconds: 1
             resources:
               requests:
                 cpu: 250m
                 memory: 750Mi
             volumeMounts:
               - mountPath: /var/lib/grafana
                 name: grafana-pv
         volumes:
           - name: grafana-pv
             persistentVolumeClaim:
               claimName: grafana-pvc
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: grafana
   spec:
     ports:
       - port: 3000
         protocol: TCP
         targetPort: http-grafana
     selector:
       app: grafana
     sessionAffinity: None
     type: LoadBalancer
   ```

1. Run the following command to send the manifest to the Kubernetes API server:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f grafana.yaml --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

   This command creates the PVC, Deployment, and Service objects.

1. Complete the following steps to verify the deployment status of each object.
   
   1. For PVC , run the following command:
   
         ```bash
         kubectl get pvc --namespace=my-grafana -o wide
         ```

   b. For Deployment, run the following command:
   
         ```bash
         kubectl get deployments --namespace=my-grafana -o wide
         ```

   3. For Service, run the following command:
   
         ```bash
         kubectl get svc --namespace=my-grafana -o wide
         ```

## Access Grafana on Managed K8s Providers

In this task, you access Grafana deployed on a Managed Kubernetes provider using a web browser. Accessing Grafana via a Web browser is straightforward if it is deployed on a Managed Kubernetes Providers as it uses the cloud providerâ€™s **LoadBalancer** to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created.

1. Run the following command to obtain the deployment information:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl get all --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

   The output returned should look similar to the following:

   ```bash
   NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   pod/grafana-69946c9bd6-kwjb6   1/1     Running   0          7m27s

   NAME              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)          AGE
   service/grafana   LoadBalancer   10.5.243.226   1.120.130.330   3000:31171/TCP   7m27s

   NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   deployment.apps/grafana   1/1     1            1           7m29s

   NAME                                 DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
   replicaset.apps/grafana-69946c9bd6   1         1         1       7m30s
   ```

1. Identify the **EXTERNAL-IP** value in the output and type it into your browser.
   
   1. The Grafana sign-in page appears.

   1. To sign in, enter `admin` for both the username and password.

3. If you do not see the EXTERNAL-IP then complete the following steps:
      
      a) Run the following command to do a port-forwarding of the Grafana service on port `3000`.

      ```bash
      kubectl port-forward service/grafana 3000:3000 --namespace=my-grafana
      ```
      
      For more information about port-forwarding, refer to [Use Port Forwarding to Access Applications in a Cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/).

      b) Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

      c) The Grafana sign-in page appears.

      c) To sign in, enter `admin` for both the username and password.

## Access Grafana using minikube

There are multiple ways to access the Grafana UI on a web browser when using minikube. For more information about minikube, refer to [How to access applications running within minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/accessing/).

This section lists the two most common options for accessing an application running in minikube.

### Option 1 Expose the Service

This option uses the `type: LoadBalancer` in the `grafana.yaml` service manifest, which makes the Service accessible through the `minikube service` command. For more information, refer to [minikube Service command usage](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/commands/service/).

1. Run the following command to obtain the Grafana service IP:
   
   ```bash
   minikube service grafana --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

   The output returns the Kubernetes URL for service in your local cluster.

   ```bash
   |------------|---------|-------------|------------------------------|
   | NAMESPACE  |  NAME   | TARGET PORT |             URL              |
   |------------|---------|-------------|------------------------------|
   | my-grafana | grafana |        3000 | http://192.168.122.144:32182 |
   |------------|---------|-------------|------------------------------|
   ðŸŽ‰  Opening service my-grafana/grafana in default browser...
   ðŸ‘‰  http://192.168.122.144:32182
   ```

1. Run a curl command to verify whether a given connection should be working in a browser under ideal circumstances.

   ```bash
   curl 192.168.122.144:32182
   ```
   The following example output determines that an endpoint has been located:

   `<a href="/login">Found</a>.`

1. Access the Grafana UI in the browser using the provided IP:Port from the command above. For example `192.168.122.144:32182`
   
     1. The Grafana sign-in page appears.

     1. To sign in to Grafana, enter `admin` for both the username and password.

### Option 2 Using Port Forwarding

If Option 1 does not work in your minikube environment (mostly depends on the network), then as an alternative you can use the **port forwarding** option for the Grafana service on port `3000`.

For more information about port forwarding, refer to [Use Port Forwarding to Access Applications in a Cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/).

1. To find the minikube IP address, run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   minikube ip
   ```
   
   The output contains the IP address that you use to access the Grafana Pod during port forwarding.
   
   A Pod is the smallest deployment unit in Kubernetes is the core building block for running applications in a Kubernetes cluster. For more information about Podâ€™s refer to the [Pod concept](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/).

2. To obtain the Grafana Pod information, run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

   The output should look similar to the following:

   ```bash
   NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   grafana-58445b6986-dxrrw   1/1     Running   0          9m54s
   ```

   It shows the Grafana POD name in the NAME column, that you use for port forwarding.

3. Run the following command for enabling the port forwarding on the POD:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward pod/grafana-58445b6986-dxrrw --namespace=my-grafana --address 0.0.0.0 3000:3000
   ```

4. To access the Grafana UI on the web browser, type the minikube IP along with the forwarded port. For example `192.168.122.144:3000`
   
   1. The Grafana sign-in page appears.

   1. To sign in to Grafana, enter `admin` for both the username and password.

## Update an existing deployment using a rolling update strategy

Rolling updates allow deployment updates to take place with no downtime by incrementally updating Pods instances with new ones. The new Pods will be scheduled on nodes with available resources. For more information about rolling updates, refer to [Performing a Rolling Update](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/).

The following steps use the `kubectl annotate` command to add the metadata and keep track of the deployment. For more information about `kubectl annotate`, refer to [kubectl annotate documentation](https://jamesdefabia.github.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_annotate/).
   
> **Note:** Instead of using the `annotate` flag, you can still use the `--record` flag. However, it has been deprecated and will be removed in the future version of Kubernetes.
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/40422

1. To view the current status of the rollout, run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout history deployment/grafana --namespace=my-grafana
   ```
   
   The output will look similar to this:

   ```bash
   deployment.apps/grafana 
   REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
   1         NONE
   ```
   
   The output shows that nothing has been updated or changed after applying the `grafana.yaml` file.

2. To add metadata to keep record of the initial deployment, run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl annotate deployment/grafana kubernetes.io/change-cause='deployed the default base yaml file' --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

3. To review the rollout history and verify the changes run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout history deployment/grafana --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

   You should see the updated information that you added in the `CHANGE-CAUSE` earlier.

### Change Grafana image version

1. To change the deployed Grafana version, run the following `kubectl edit` command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl edit deployment grafana --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

   In the editor, change the container image under the `kind: Deployment` section for e.g.:

   - From

     - ```yaml image: grafana/grafana-oss:10.0.1```

   - To
     - ```yaml image: grafana/grafana-oss-dev:10.1.0-124419pre```

1. Save the changes. You will get a message once your file is saved:

   ```bash
   deployment.apps/grafana edited
   ```
   This means that the new changes have been applied.

1. To verify that the rollout on the cluster is successful, run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout status deployment grafana --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

   A successful deployment rollout means that the Grafana Dev cluster is now available.

1. To check the statuses of all deployed objects, run the following command and include the `-o wide` flag to get more detailed output:

   ```bash
   kubectl get all --namespace=my-grafana -o wide
   ```

   You should see the newly deployed `grafana-oss-dev` image.

1. To verify it, access the Grafana UI in the browser using the provided IP:Port from the command above.
   
   1. The Grafana sign-in page appears.
   1. To sign in to Grafana, enter `admin` for both the username and password.
   1. On the top right corner, click the help icon which will display the version.
  
1. Add the change cause metadata to keep track of things using the commands:

   ```bash
   kubectl annotate deployment grafana --namespace=my-grafana kubernetes.io/change-cause='using grafana-oss-dev:10.1.0-124419pre for testing'
   ```

1. To verify, run the `kubectl rollout history` command:

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout history deployment grafana --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

   You will see an output similar to this:

   ```bash
   deployment.apps/grafana 
   REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
   1         deploying the default yaml
   2         using grafana-oss-dev:10.1.0-124419pre for testing
   ```

This means that `REVISION#2` is the current version.

> **Note:** The last line of the `kubectl rollout history deployment` command output is the one which is currnetly active and running on your Kubernetes enviorment.

### Rollback a deployment

When the Grafana deployment becomes unstable due to crash looping, bugs, etc. you can roll back a deployment to an earlier version (aka `REVISION`).

By default, Kubernetes deployment rollout history remains in the system so that you can roll back at any time. For more information, refer toÂ  [Rolling Back to a Previous Revision](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-back-to-a-previous-revision).

1. To list all possible `REVISION`, run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout history deployment grafana --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

1. To roll back to a previous version, run the `kubectl rollout undo` command and provide a revision number.
   
   Example: To roll back to a previous version, specify it `REVISION` number (which was displayed via `kubectl rollout history deployment` command) in the `--to-revision` parameter.

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment grafana --to-revision=1 --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

1. To verify that the rollback on the cluster is successful, run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout status deployment grafana --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

1. Access the Grafana UI in the browser using the provided IP:Port from the command above.

   1. The Grafana sign-in page appears.
   1. To sign in to Grafana, enter `admin` for both the username and password.
   1. On the top right corner, click the help icon which will display the version.

1. To see the new rollout history, run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout history deployment grafana --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

If you need to go back to any other `REVISION`, just repeat the above steps and use the correct revision number in the `--to-revision` parameter.

## Troubleshooting

### Collecting logs

It is important to view the Grafana server logs while troubleshooting any issues.

1. To check the Grafana logs, run the following command:
   ```bash
   # dump Pod logs for a Deployment (single-container case)
   kubectl logs --namespace=my-grafana deploy/grafana
   ```

1. If you have multiple containers running in the deployment, then run the following command to get the logs only for the Grafana deployment:
   ```bash
   # dump Pod logs for a Deployment (multi-container case)
   kubectl logs --namespace=my-grafana deploy/grafana -c grafana
   ```

For more information about accessing Kubernetes application logs, refer to [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#interacting-with-running-pods) and [Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#interacting-with-deployments-and-services).

### Increasing log levels to debug mode

By default, the Grafana log level is set to `info`, but you can increase it to `debug` mode to fetch information needed to diagnose, troubleshoot a problem. For more information about Grafana log levels, refer to [Configuring logs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#log).

The following example uses the Kubernetes ConfigMap which is an API object that stores non-confidential data in key-value pairs. For more information, refer to [Kubernetes ConfigMap Concept](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/).

1. Create a blank file and name it e.g. `grafana.ini` and add the following:

   ```bash
   [log]
   ; # Either "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "critical", default is "info"
   ; # we change from info to debug level
   level = debug
   ```

   This example adds the portion of the log section from the configuration file. You can refer to the [Configure Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/) documentation to view all the default configuration settings.

1. To add the configuration file into the Kubernetes cluster via the ConfigMap object, run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl create configmap ge-config --from-file=/path/to/file/grafana.ini --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

1. Verify the ConfigMap object creation, by using the command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get configmap --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

1. Open the `grafana.yaml` file and In the Deployment section:
   
   1. Provide the mount path to the custom configuration (`/etc/grafana`) and reference the newly created ConfigMap for it.
      
   ```bash
   ---
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     labels:
       app: grafana
     name: grafana
   # the rest of the code remains the same.   
   ...
   ....
   ...
               requests:
               cpu: 250m
               memory: 750Mi
           volumeMounts:
             - mountPath: /var/lib/grafana
               name: grafana-pv
              # This is to mount the volume for the custom configuration 
             - mountPath: /etc/grafana
               name: ge-config    
       volumes:
         - name: grafana-pv
           persistentVolumeClaim:
             claimName: grafana-pvc
	       # This is to provide the reference to the ConfigMap for the volume
         - name: ge-config
           configMap:
             name: ge-config
   ```

1. Deploy the manifest using the following kubectl apply command:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f grafana.yaml --namespace=my-grafana   
   ```

1. To verify the status, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   # first check the rollout status
   kubectl rollout status deployment grafana --namespace=my-grafana
   
   # then check the deployment and configMap information
   kubectl get all --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

1. To verify it, access the Grafana UI in the browser using the provided IP:Port

   1. The Grafana sign-in page appears.
   1. To sign in to Grafana, enter `admin` for both the username and password.
   1. Navigate to Server Admin -> Settings and then search for log. You should see the level to debug mode.

### Using the --dry-run command

You can use the Kubernetes `--dry-run` command to send requests to modifying endpoints and determine if the request would have succeeded.

Performing a dry run can be very useful for catching errors or unintended consequences before they occur.Â For more information, refer to [Kubernetes Dry-run](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/576-dry-run/README.md).

Example:

Perform a dry run when you make changes to the `grafana.yaml` such as using a new image version, or adding new labels and you want to determine if there are syntax errors or conflicts.

To perform a dry run, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f grafana.yaml --dry-run=server --namespace=grafana
```

If there are no errors, then the output will look similar to this:

```bash
persistentvolumeclaim/grafana-pvc unchanged (server dry run)
deployment.apps/grafana unchanged (server dry run)
service/grafana unchanged (server dry run)
```

Incase, if there are any errors or warnings, you will see them in the terminal.

## Removing the Grafana Deployment

Incase if you want to remove any of deployment objects, then it can be done using the `kubectl delete command`.

Examples:

1. If you want to remove the complete Grafana depomyent, run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f grafana.yaml --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

   It will delete the Deployment, persistentvolumeclaim and service objects.

1. To delete the ConfigMap, run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete configmap ge-config --namespace=my-grafana
   ```

## Deploy Grafana Enterprise on Kubernetes

The process for deploying Grafana Enterprise is almost identical to the preceding process, except for additional steps that are required for adding your license file.

### Obtain Grafana Enterprise license

To run Grafana Enterprise, you need a valid license.
To obtain a license, [contact a Grafana Labs representative](/contact?about=grafana-enterprise).
This topic assumes that you have a valid license in a `license.jwt` file.
Associate your license with a URL that you can use later in the topic.

### Create license secret

Create a Kubernetes secret from your license file using the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic ge-license --from-file=/path/to/your/license.jwt
```

### Create Grafana Enterprise configuration

Create a Grafana configuration file with the name `grafana.ini`. Then paste the content below.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
You will have to update the `root_url` field to the url associated with the license you were given.
{{% /admonition %}}

```yaml
[enterprise]
license_path = /etc/grafana/license/license.jwt
[server]
root_url =/your/license/root/url

```

### Create Configmap for Grafana Enterprise configuration

Create a Kubernetes Configmap from your `grafana.ini` file with the following command:

```bash
kubectl create configmap ge-config --from-file=/path/to/your/grafana.ini
```

### Create Grafana Enterprise Kubernetes manifest

Create a `grafana.yaml` file, and copy-and-paste the following content into it.
The YAML that follows is identical to the one for a Grafana installation, except for the additional references to the Configmap that contains your Grafana configuration file and the secret that has your license.

{{% admonition type="caution" %}}
If you use `LoadBalancer` in the Service and depending on your cloud platform and network configuration, doing so might expose your Grafana instance to the Internet. To eliminate this risk, use `ClusterIP` to restrict access from within the cluster Grafana is deployed to.

1. Send manifest to Kubernetes API Server
   `kubectl apply -f grafana.yaml`

1. Check that it worked by running the following:
   `kubectl port-forward service/grafana 3000:3000`

1. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser. You should see the Grafana login page.

1. Use `admin` for both the username and password to login.
   If it worked, you should see `Enterprise (Licensed)` at the bottom of the page.
