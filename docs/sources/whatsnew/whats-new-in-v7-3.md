# What's new in Grafana v7.3

This topic includes the release notes for the Grafana v7.3. For all details, read the full [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

The main highlights are:

- [**Shorten URL for dashboards and Explore**]({{< relref "shorten-url-for-dashboards-and-explore" >}})

## Shorten URL for dashboards and Explore

This is an amazing new feature that was created in cooperation with one of our community members. The new **share shortened link** capability allows you to create smaller and simpler URLs of the format `/goto/:uid` instead of using longer URLs that can contain complex query parameters. In Explore, you can create a shortened link by clicking on the share button in Explore toolbar. In the dashboards, a shortened url option is available through the share panel or dashboard button.

## Upgrading

See [upgrade notes]({{< relref "../installation/upgrading.md" >}}).

## Changelog

Check out [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of new features, changes, and bug fixes.
