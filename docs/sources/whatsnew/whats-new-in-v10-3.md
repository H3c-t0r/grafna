## Feature
<!-- Name of contributor -->
<!-- _[Generally available | Available in private/public preview | Experimental] in Grafana [Open Source, Enterprise]_
Description. Include an overview of the feature and problem it solves, and where to learn more (like a link to the docs).
{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Use full URLs for links. When linking to versioned docs, replace the version with the version interpolation placeholder (for example, <GRAFANA_VERSION>, <TEMPO_VERSION>, <MIMIR_VERSION>) so the system can determine the correct set of docs to point to. For example, "https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/" becomes "https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/administration/".
