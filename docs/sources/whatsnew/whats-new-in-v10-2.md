# Whatâ€™s new in Grafana v10.2

Welcome to Grafana 10.2! Read on to learn about changes to ...

For even more detail about all the changes in this release, refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). For the specific steps we recommend when you upgrade to v10.2, check out our [Upgrade Guide]({{< relref "../upgrade-guide/upgrade-v10.2/index.md" >}}).

## Calculate visualization min/max individually per field

<!-- Oscar Kilhed -->

_Generally available in Grafana_

When visualizing multiple fields with a wide spread of values, calculating the min/max value of the visualization based on all fields can hide useful details.
{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/panels-visualizations/globalminmax.png" caption="Stat panel visualization with min/max calculated from all fields" > }}
In this example in the stats panel, it's hard to get an idea of how the values of each series relates to the historical values of that series. The threshold of 10% is exceeded by the A-series even though the A-series is below 10% of its historical maximum.

Now, you can automatically calculate the min/max of each visualized field, based on the lowest and highest value of the individual field! This setting is available in the standard options in most visualizations.

{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/panels-visualizations/localminmax.png" caption="Stat panel visualization with min/max calculated per field" > }}
In this example, using the same data, with the min and max calculated for each individual field, we get a much better understanding of how the current value relates to the historical values. The A-series no longer exceeds the 10% threshold, it is in fact at a historical low!

This is not only useful in the stat panel. Gauge panel, bar gauge, status history, table cells formatted by thresholds, and gauge table cells all benefit from this addition!

## Configure refresh token handling separately for OAuth providers

<!-- Mihaly Gyongyosi -->

_Available in public preview in all editions of Grafana._

With Grafana v9.3, we introduced a feature toggle called `accessTokenExpirationCheck`. It improves the security of Grafana by checking the expiration of the access token and automatically refreshing the expired access token when the user is logged in using one of the OAuth providers.

With the current release, we introduce a new configuration option for each OAuth provider called `use_refresh_token` that allows you to configure whether the particular OAuth integration should use refresh tokens to automatically refresh access tokens when they expire. In addition, to further improve security and provide secure defaults, `use_refresh_token` is enabled by default for providers that support either refreshing tokens automatically or client-controlled fetching of refresh tokens. It's enabled by default for the following OAuth providers: `AzureAD`, `GitLab`, `Google`.

For more information on how to set up refresh token handling, please refer to [the documentation of the particular OAuth provider.]({{< relref "../setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/" >}}).

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
The `use_refresh_token` configuration must be used in conjunction with the `accessTokenExpirationCheck` feature toggle. If you disable the `accessTokenExpirationCheck` feature toggle, Grafana will not check the expiration of the access token and will not automatically refresh the expired access token, even if the `use_refresh_token` configuration is set to `true`.

The `accessTokenExpirationCheck` feature toggle will be removed in Grafana v10.3.

## Add dashboard and data source permissions to service accounts

<!-- Jo Guerreiro -->

_Generally available in Grafana_

Service accounts allow you to create a token that can be used to authenticate with Grafana.
You can use this token to access Grafana's API, as well as, data sources and dashboards that the service account has access to.

In this release, we've added the ability to assign dashboard, folder, and data source permissions to service accounts.
This means that you can now create a service account that can be used to access a specific dashboard or data source and nothing else.

{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/screenshot-grafana-10-2-sa-managed-permissions.png" caption="Datasource permissions in 10.2" > }}

This is useful if you want to limit the access service accounts have to your Grafana instance.

## Role mapping support for Google OIDC

<!-- Jo Guerreiro -->

_Generally available in Grafana Open Source and Enterprise_

You can now map Google groups to Grafana organizational roles when using Google OIDC.
This is useful if you want to limit the access users have to your Grafana instance.

We've also added support for controlling allowed groups when using Google OIDC.

Refer to the [Google Authentication documentation](http://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA VERSION>/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/google/index.md) to learn how to use these new options.
