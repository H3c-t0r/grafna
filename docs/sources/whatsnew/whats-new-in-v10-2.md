## Calculate visualization min/max individually per field

<!-- Oscar Kilhed -->

_Generally available in Grafana_

When visualizing multiple fields with a wide spread of values, calculating the min/max value of the visualization based on all fields can hide useful details.
{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/panels-visualizations/globalminmax.png" caption="Stat panel visualization with min/max calculated from all fields" > }}
In this example in the stats panel, it's hard to get an idea of how the values of each series relates to the historical values of that series. The threshold of 10% is exceeded by the A-series even though the A-series is below 10% of its historical maximum.

Now, you can automatically calculate the min/max of each visualized field, based on the lowest and highest value of the individual field! This setting is available in the standard options in most visualizations.

{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/panels-visualizations/localminmax.png" caption="Stat panel visualization with min/max calculated per field" > }}
In this example, using the same data, with the min and max calculated for each individual field, we get a much better understanding of how the current value relates to the historical values. The A-series no longer exceeds the 10% threshold, it is in fact at a historical low!

This is not only useful in the stat panel. Gauge panel, bar gauge, status history, table cells formatted by thresholds, and gauge table cells all benefit from this addition!

## Add Dashboard and Datasource permissions to Service accounts

<!-- Jo Guerreiro -->

_Generally available in Grafana_

Service accounts allow you to create a token that can be used to authenticate with Grafana.
This token can be used to access Grafana's API, and can be used to access data sources and dashboards that the service account has access to.

In this release, we have added the ability to assign dashboard and datasource permissions to service accounts.
This means that you can now create a service account that can be used to access a specific dashboard or datasource and nothing else.

{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/screenshot-grafana-10-2-sa-managed-permissions.png" caption="Datasource permissions in 10.2" > }}

This is useful if you want to limit the access service accounts have to your Grafana instance.

## Role mapping support for Google OIDC

<!-- Jo Guerreiro -->

_Generally available in Grafana_

You can now map Google groups to Grafana organizational roles when using Google OIDC.
This is useful if you want to limit the access users have to your Grafana instance.

Support has also been added for controlling allowed groups when using Google OIDC.

Refer to the [Google Authentication documentation]({{< relref "../setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/google/index.md">}} to learn how to use these new options.
