## Transformations

As our work on improving the user experience of transforming data continues, we've also been adding new capabilities to transformations.

### Support for dashboard variables in transformations

<!-- Oscar Kilhed, Victor Marin -->

_Experimental in all editions of Grafana_

Previously the only transformation that supported [dashboard variables]({{< relref "../dashboards/variables/" >}}) was the **add field from calculation transformation**. We have now extended the support for variables to **Filter by value**, **Create heatmap**, **Histogram**, **Sort by**, **Limit**, **Filter by name** and **Join by field**. We've also made it easier to find the correct dashboard variable by displaying available variables in the fields that support variables, either in the dropdown or as a suggestion when you type **$** or press `<ctrl+space>` {{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/transformations/completion.png" caption="Input with dashboard variable suggestions" >}}

### New modes for the add field from calculation transformation

<!-- Victor Marin -->

The add field from calculation transformation has received two new modes.

**Unary operations** let you apply mathematical operations to a field. The currently supported operations are - **Absolute value (abs)** - Returns the absolute value of a given expression. It represents its distance from zero as a positive number. - **Natural exponential (exp)** - Returns _e_ raised to the power of a given expression. - **Natural logarithm (ln)** - Returns the natural logarithm of a given expression. - **Floor (floor)** - Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given expression. - **Ceiling (ceil)** - Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given expression.

**Row index** adds a field that represents the row index of the row.

### New transformation: Format string

<!-- Solomon Dubock, BI Squad -->

With the new format string transformation you can manipulate string fields to look nicer! The currently supported operations are.

- **Change case** changes the case of your string to upper case, lower case, sentence case, title case, pascal case, camel case or snake case.
- **Trim** removes white space characters at the start and end of your string.
- **Substring** selects a part of your string field.
