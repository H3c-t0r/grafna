## Authentication and authorization

### Configure refresh token handling separately for OAuth providers

<!-- Mihaly Gyongyosi -->

_Available in public preview in all Grafana Open Source and Enterprise_

With Grafana v9.3, we introduced a feature toggle called `accessTokenExpirationCheck`. It improves the security of Grafana by checking the expiration of the access token and automatically refreshing the expired access token when a user is logged in using one of the OAuth providers.

With the current release, we've introduced a new configuration option for each OAuth provider called `use_refresh_token` that allows you to configure whether the particular OAuth integration should use refresh tokens to automatically refresh access tokens when they expire. In addition, to further improve security and provide secure defaults, `use_refresh_token` is enabled by default for providers that support either refreshing tokens automatically or client-controlled fetching of refresh tokens. It's enabled by default for the following OAuth providers: `AzureAD`, `GitLab`, `Google`.

For more information on how to set up refresh token handling, please refer to [the documentation of the particular OAuth provider.](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA VERSION>/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/).

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
The `use_refresh_token` configuration must be used in conjunction with the `accessTokenExpirationCheck` feature toggle. If you disable the `accessTokenExpirationCheck` feature toggle, Grafana won't check the expiration of the access token and won't automatically refresh the expired access token, even if the `use_refresh_token` configuration is set to `true`.

The `accessTokenExpirationCheck` feature toggle will be removed in Grafana v10.3.

### Permission validation on custom role creation and update

<!-- Mihaly Gyongyosi -->

_Generally available in Grafana Enterprise_

With the current release, we enabled RBAC permission validation (`rbac.permission_validation_enabled` setting) by default. This means that the permissions provided in the request during custom role creation or update are validated against the list of [available permissions and their scopes](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA VERSION>/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/custom-role-actions-scopes/#action-definitions). If the request contains a permission that is not available or the scope of the permission is not valid, the request is rejected with an error message.
