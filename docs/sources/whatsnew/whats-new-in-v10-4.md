Use full URLs for links. When linking to versioned docs, replace the version with the version interpolation placeholder (for example, <GRAFANA_VERSION>, <TEMPO_VERSION>, <MIMIR_VERSION>) so the system can determine the correct set of docs to point to. For example, "https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/" becomes "https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/administration/".
