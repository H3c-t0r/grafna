# Send a support bundle to Grafana Labs support

When you encounter problems with your Grafana instance, you can send us a support bundle. This bundle contains information about your Grafana instance, such as:

- Grafana version
- Installed plugins
- Grafana configuration
- Deployed database information and migrations

To generate a support bundle and send the support bundle to Grafana Labs via a support ticket:

a. Click the Help icon.

b. Click Support Bundles.

![Support bundle panel](/static/img/docs/troubleshooting/support-bundle.png)

c. Click New Support Bundle.

d. Select the components that you want to include in the support bundle.

e. Click Create.

f. Click Download once the support bundle is ready.

Grafana downloads the support bundle to an Archive (tar.gz) file.
