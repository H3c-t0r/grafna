# Manage and inspect variables

The variables page lets you [add][] variables and [manage](#manage-variables) existing variables. It also allows you to [inspect](#inspect-variables) variables and identify whether a variable is being referenced (or used) in other variables or dashboard.

## Manage variables

You can take the following actions on the variables page:

- **Move:** You can move a variable up or down the list using drag and drop.
- **Clone:** To clone a variable, click the clone icon from the set of icons on the right. This creates a copy of the variable with the name of the original variable prefixed with `copy_of_`.
- **Delete:** To delete a variable, click the trash icon from the set of icons on the right.

## Inspect variables

The variables page lets you easily identify whether a variable is being referenced (or used) in other variables or dashboard. In addition, you can also [add][] and [manage variables](#manage-variables) on this page.
