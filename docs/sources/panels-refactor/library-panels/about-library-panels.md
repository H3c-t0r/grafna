# About Grafana panel libraries

Library panels allow users to create reusable panels where any changes made to one instance of the library panel is reflected on every dashboard affecting all other instances where the panel is used. These panels can be saved in folders alongside Dashboards and streamline reuse of panels across multiple dashboards.
