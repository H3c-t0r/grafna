# About repeating panels or rows

{{< docs/shared "panels/repeat-panels-intro.md" >}}

Template variables can be very useful to dynamically change your queries across a whole dashboard. If you want
Grafana to dynamically create new panels or rows based on what values you have selected, you can use the _Repeat_ feature.

## Grafana Play examples

You can see examples in the following dashboards:

- [Prometheus repeat](https://play.grafana.org/d/000000036/prometheus-repeat)
- [Repeated Rows Dashboard](https://play.grafana.org/d/000000153/repeat-rows).
