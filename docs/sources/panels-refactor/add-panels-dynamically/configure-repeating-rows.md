# Configure repeating rows

As seen above with the panels you can also repeat rows if you have variables set with `Multi-value` or
`Include all value` selection option.

To enable this feature you need to first add a new _Row_ using the _Add Panel_ menu. Then by hovering the row title and
clicking on the cog button, you will access the `Row Options` configuration panel. You can then select the variable
you want to repeat the row for.

It may be a good idea to use a variable in the row title as well.
