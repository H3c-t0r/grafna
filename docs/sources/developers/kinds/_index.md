# Grafana schema

In the Grafana ecosystem, there are three basic Kind categories and associated schema categories:
- [Core Kinds]({{< relref "core/" >}})
- Custom Kinds
- [Composable Kinds]({{< relref "composable/" >}})

To understand how to write Grafana schemas: start from nothing, and confidently iterate to a mature initial version, see [Grafana Kinds - From Zero to Maturity]({{< relref "maturity/" >}}).
