description: An annotated list of Grafana plugins using AngularJS.

# Plugins using AngularJS

The use of AngularJS in Grafana has been [deprecated]({{< relref "../angular_deprecation" >}}) and support for it will be removed by default in Grafana 11.

This page is to help users of Grafana understand how they might be impacted by the removal of Angular support, and whether a migration option exists.

## What should I do with the information below?

- Consider the advice on whether to update, migrate to a listed alternative, or explore the Grafana plugins [catalog](/grafana/plugins) to find the most suitable for your use case.
- Use our [open source tooling](https://github.com/grafana/detect-angular-dashboards) to list dashboards which have a dependency on Angular plugins
- Check your Grafana instances for usage of these plugins - see information here on [browsing installed plugins]({{< relref "../../administration/plugin-management/#browse-plugins" >}}).
- Grafana Enterprise customers and users of Grafana Cloud can also leverage [usage insights]({{< relref "../../dashboards/assess-dashboard-usage/" >}}) to prioritize any migration efforts.
- Review the plugin source repositories to add your support to any migration issues or consider forking.

## Private plugins

Grafana OSS and Grafana Enterprise support the creation of private plugins for use on local instances. These plugins may have a dependency on Angular and require an update.

The open source tooling listed above will include private plugins in its report **if the Grafana version is v10.1.0 or later**.

Additionally, warning icons and messages will be displayed when browsing the catalog via **Administration** > **Plugins and Data** > **Plugins** in your local instance.

## I'm a plugin author

We are greatly appreciative of the developers who have contributed plugins to the Grafana ecosystem, your work has helped support millions of users to gain insights into their data. Guidance on migrating a plugin to React can be found in our [migration guide](/developers/plugin-tools/migration-guides/migrate-angularjs-to-react). If you would like to add any specific migration guidance for your plugin here or update our assessment, please open a PR by clicking the `Suggest an edit` button at the bottom of this page.

## Automatic migration of plugins

Certain legacy Grafana panel plugins will automatically update to their react based replacements when Angular support is disabled. This migration is usually available within the panel options, as shown in the screenshot below for World Map. Automatic migration can also be tested by appending `&__feature.autoMigrateOldPanels=true` to the dashboard URL in your browser.

Automatic migration is supported for the following plugins, each of the target plugin is included in Grafana as a Core plugin and does not require installation.

| Plugin      | Migration Target |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Graph (old) | Time Series      |
| Singlestat  | Stat             |
| Stat (old)  | Stat             |
| Table (old) | Table            |
| Worldmap    | Geomap           |

A dashboard will still need to be saved with the new plugin ID to persist the change.

# AngularJS based plugins

This table lists plugins which we have detected as having a dependency on Angular. For alternatives, consider included [Visualizations]({{< relref "../../panels-visualizations/visualizations" >}}) and [Data sources]({{< relref "../../datasources" >}}), as well as external plugins from the [catalog](/grafana/plugins).
