# AngularJS support deprecation

AngularJS plugin support is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. There are still many community plugins that rely on Grafana's AngularJS plugin support to work. The same is true for many internal (private) plugins that have been developed by Grafana users over the years. Grafana version 9 has a server configuration option that is global to the entire instance and controls whether AngularJS plugin support is available or not. By default, AngularJS support is still enabled, but that will change soon once we complete the migration of all AngularJS code in the core product.

## Why are we deprecating AngularJS support?

AngularJS is an old frontend framework whose active development stopped many years ago. Therefore, it poses a security risk. As Grafana itself had already started migrating to React in v5, this presented the most logical framework for our plugin platform. AngularJS also requires unsafe-eval in the CSP (Content Security Policy) settings, which also reduces the security of running JavaScript in the browser.

## When will AngularJS plugins stop working?

In Grafana 11, which will be released in preview in April 2024 and generally available in May, we will change the default behavior of the [angular_support_enabled](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/d61bcdf4ca5e69489e0067c56fbe7f0bfdf84ee4/conf/defaults.ini#L362) configuration parameter to turn off support for AngularJS based plugins. In case you still rely on [AngularJS-based plugins]({{< relref "./angular-plugins/" >}}) developed internally or by the community, you will need to enable this option to continue using them.

New Grafana Cloud users will be unable to request for support to be added to their instance.

## When will we remove AngularJS support completely?

Our current plan is to completely remove any remaining support for AngularJS plugins in version 12. Including the removal of the [angular_support_enabled](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/d61bcdf4ca5e69489e0067c56fbe7f0bfdf84ee4/conf/defaults.ini#L362) configuration parameter.

## How do I migrate an AngularJS plugin to React?

Depending on if itâ€™s a data source plugin, panel plugin, or app plugin the process will differ.

For panels, the rendering logic could in some cases be easily preserved, but all options need to be redone to use the declarative options framework. For data source plugins the query editor and config options will likely need a total rewrite.

## How do I encourage a community plugin to migrate?

We encourage you to locate the repository of the corresponding plugin and create or upvote an Issue within it if you are using a plugin that is still based on AngularJS.
