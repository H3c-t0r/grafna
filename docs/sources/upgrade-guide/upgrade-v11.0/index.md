## Technical notes

### PostgreSQL data source plugin update

<!-- Gabor Farkas -->

If you use the PostgreSQL data source plugin and store certificates using the `Certificate content` method, Grafana previously created temporary files in Grafana's [data](/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#data) folder. Grafana 11 does not use temporary files for this functionality anymore. But, existing temporary files will not be deleted, we recommend deleting them manually. To find them, look for the `tls` subfolder in the `data` folder, it contains subfolders named based on plugin ids, and these subfolders contain files named `client.*` or `root.*`. These are not used anymore, and can be deleted.
