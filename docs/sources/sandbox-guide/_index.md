Thanks for testing out Grafana. Here is a brief guide on navigating through our sandbox model. 

## Icon Guide

- **Search:**

In Grafana, a user can search through various dashboards. A dashboard is a set of one or more panels (https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels/) organizedand arranged into one or more rows.

Grafana ships with a variety of panels making it easy to construct the right queries, and customize the visualization so that you can create the perfect dashboard for your need.

- **Dashboards**

This icon displays your current dashboards. Hovering over the dashboard icon canalso provide you with the options to browse existing dashboards and playlists (https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/playlist/) 

To simply add a new panel to your dashboard home page, simply click the "Add Panel" icon at the top of the page.

- **Explore**

Clicking the Explore icon takes you to a screen where you can focus on building your data query. 

Grafanaâ€™s dashboard UI is all about building dashboards for visualization. Explore strips away the dashboard and panel options so that you can focus on the query. It helps you iterate until you have a working query and then think about building a dashboard.

- **Cloud Alerting**

Alerts allow you to learn about problems in your systems moments after they occur. Robust and actionable alerts help you identify and resolve issues quickly, minimizing disruption to your services.

The newest release is Grafana 8.0. This version allows a user to: 
- Create and manage Grafana alerts
- Create and manage Grafana Mimir and Loki managed alerts
- View alerting information from Prometheus and Alertmanager compatible data sources

- **Machine Learning**

Grafana Machine Learning is a part of Grafana Cloud(https://grafana.com/products/cloud/).

Grafana Machine Learning gives Grafana Cloud users the ability to create predictions of the current or future state of their systems.

To create predictions, you define:
-  A source query (the time series to be modeled)
- Tthe configuration for the machine learning model.

 The system will train the model in the background.

Once a model has been successfully trained, you can issue queries to predict the value of the series at different times into the future. The model will also return the confidence bounds for the predicted values.

Over time the model will keep learning new patterns, so it automatically evolves along with your data.

- **Synthetic Monitoring**

Synthetic Monitoring is a part of Grafana Cloud(https://grafana.com/products/cloud/)

Synthetic monitoring provides you with insights into how your applications and services are behaving from an external point of view.

Some features of Synthetic Monitoring are:

- Visualizing and querying logs using pre-build dashboards
- Troubleshooting issues using log exploration
- ...and so much more!
