# Manage role assignments

> **Note:** Fine-grained access control is in beta, and you can expect changes in future releases.

Currently [roles]({{< relref "../roles.md" >}}) can only be assigned to users.
[Manage user role assignments]({{< relref "manage-user-role-assignments.md" >}}) page provides details on how to grant and revoke user role assignments.
