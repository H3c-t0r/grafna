# Concepts

There are few main parts in the fine-grained access control which you would need to understand:

1. You would need to manage [Roles]({{< relref "./roles.md" >}}) and [Permissions]({{< relref "./permissions.md" >}}).
1. For granting or revoking access to your users, you would need to create or remove [built-in role assignments]({{< relref "./roles.md#built-in-role-assignments" >}}).
