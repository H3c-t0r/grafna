# Concepts

To leverage access control, there are few important parts you would need to manage [Roles]({{< relref "./roles.md" >}}) and [Permissions]({{< relref "./permissions.md" >}}).

To grant or revoke access to your users, you can assign or unassign roles to the currently available Organization roles (`Admin`, `Editor`, `Viewer`) or Grafana Server Admin role.
See [built-in role assignments]({{< relref "./roles.md#built-in-role-assignments" >}}) for more information.

To understand how to work with the roles and permissions, refer to [Managing roles and permissions]({{< relref "../managing-roles-permissions.md" >}}).
