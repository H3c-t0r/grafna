# License expiration 

If your license has expired, then your Grafana admin needs to upload a new *license.jwt* file to the location in the `enterprise.license_path` directory (default is your Grafana data directory). This file can be downloaded from your Grafana Cloud organizationâ€™s license page. Restart Grafana once the file is in place.

Although you'll be able to access most of Grafana as usual, some functionality stops working when the license expires and a banner informs all users that the license has expired.

> You should replace your license as soon as possible. Running Grafana Enterprise with an expired license is unsupported and can lead to unexpected consequences.

## Data source permissions

Your current data source permissions will keep working as expected, but you'll be unable to add new data source permissions until the license has been renewed.

## Reporting

You won't be able to configure new reports or generate previews.
Scheduled reports will not be generated or sent.

## SAML authentication

SAML is not affected by an expired license.

## Enterprise plugins

Enterprise plugins might stop working.

## White labeling

The white labeling feature is turned off, meaning that any white labeling options will not have any effect.
