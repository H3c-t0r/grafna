# Expired License

If your license has expired, your Grafana admin needs to upload a new *license.jwt* file to the location in the `enterprise.license_path` directory (default your Grafana data directory). This file can be downloaded from your Grafana Cloud organizationâ€™s license page. Restart Grafana once the file is in place.

Although you'll be able to access most of Grafana as usual, some functionality will stop working when the license expires and a banner will appear informing all users that the license has expired.

> You should replace your license as soon as possible. Running Grafana Enterprise with an expired license is unsupported and can lead to unexpected consequences.

## Datasource Permissions

- Your current data source permissions will keep working as expected, but you'll be unable to add new data source permissions until the license has been replaced.

## Reporting

- You won't be able to configure new reports or generate previews.
- Scheduled reports will not be generated or sent.

## SAML

- SAML is not affected by an expired license.

## Enterprise Datasources

- Enterprise datasources may stop working.

## Whitelabeling

- The whitelabeling feature will be disabled.
