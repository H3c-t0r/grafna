# Request security

> **Note:** Available in Grafana Enterprise v7.4+.

Request security introduces ways to limit requests from the Grafana server and focuses on requests generated by users.

Example:
- datasource metric queries
- alert notifications

This can be used to limit access to internal systems that the server Grafana runs on can access but that users of Grafana should not be able to access. This feature does not affect traffic from the Grafana users browser.

Note: While request security works with backend plugins, it is possible to create a backend plugin that bypasses this security.

## IP and hostname blocking

It's possible to limit requests based on hostname and/or ip addresses in two ways.

### Deny list

Any request to a host or IP on the deny-list will be blocked.

### Allow list

If there are at least one host or IP on the allow-list any request to hosts or IP:s not on the allow-list will be blocked.

### Example

```toml
[security.egress]
# a list of hostnames or IP adresses separated by spaces for which outgoing requests will be blocked
host_deny_list = supersecret.internal 192.168.1.10
# a list of hostnames or IP adresses separated by spaces for which requests will be allowed, all other requests will be blocked
host_allow_list = prometheus.internal

```

## Drop headers and cookies

It's possible to set a list of cookies or headers that will be dropped from outgoing requests.

Example:

```toml
[security.egress]
# a list of headers that will be stripped from outgoing datasource and alerting requests
header_drop_list = user
# a list of cookies that will be stripped from outgoing datasource requests (case sensitive)
cookie_drop_list = session_id
```
