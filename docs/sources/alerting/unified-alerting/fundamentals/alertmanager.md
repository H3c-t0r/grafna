# Alertmanager

The Alertmanager helps both group and manage alert rules, adding a layer of orchestration on top of the alerting engines. To learn more, see [Prometheus Alertmanager documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/).

Grafana includes built-in support for Prometheus Alertmanager. By default, notifications for Grafana managed alerts are handled by the embedded Alertmanager that is part of core Grafana. You can configure the Alertmanager's contact points, notification policies, silences, and templates from the alerting UI by selecting the `Grafana` option from the Alertmanager drop-down.

> **Note:** Before v8.2, the configuration of the embedded Alertmanager was shared across organizations. If you are on an older Grafana version, we recommend that you use Grafana 8 Alerts only if you have one organization. Otherwise, your contact points are visible to all organizations.

Grafana 8 alerting added support for external Alertmanager configuration. When you add an [Alertmanager data source]({{< relref "../../../datasources/alertmanager.md" >}}), the Alertmanager drop-down shows a list of available external Alertmanager data sources. Select a data source to create and manage alerting for standalone Cortex or Loki data sources.

## External Alertmanagers

You can configure one or many external Alertmanagers to receive alerts generated by Grafana. If configured, both the internal Grafana Alertmanager **and** any configured external Alertmanagers will receive _all_ alerts generated by Grafana.

You can do the setup in the "Admin" tab within the Grafana v8 Alerts UI.

### Add a new external Alertmanager

1. In the Grafana menu, click the Alerting (bell) icon to open the Alerting page listing existing alerts.
2. Click Admin from the set of tabs
3. Scroll down to the External Alertmanager section
4. Click the Add Alertmanager button, a modal opens.
5. Add the URL and port for the Alertmanager you wish to configure, there is no need to specify the path suffix e.g. `/api/v(1|2)/alerts`. Grafana will add this.
6. The URL is shown in the table with a pending status, after a short period Grafana will verify that the Alertmanager is discovered and it will change to active. No requests are made to the external Alertmanager at this point, the verification is meant to signal that we're ready to send but not that sends will be successful.

### Edit an external Alertmanager

1. Click the pen symbol to the right of the Alertmanager row in the table.
2. When the modal opens, you will see all URLs added. Change the URL you want to update and click the Add Alertmanager button.
3. The edited URL will be pending until Grafana verifies it again.
