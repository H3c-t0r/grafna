# Pause an alert

Once youâ€™ve acknowledged an alert, consider pausing it. This can be useful to avoid sending subsequent alerts while you work on a fix.

1. In the Grafana side bar, hover your cursor over the Alerting (bell) icon and then click **Alert Rules**. All configured alert rules are listed, along with their current state.
2. Find your alert in the list, and click the **Pause** icon on the right. The **Pause** icon turns into a **Play** icon.
3. Click the **Play** icon to resume evaluation of your alert.
