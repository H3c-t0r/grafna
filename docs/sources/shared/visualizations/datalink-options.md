Data links allow you to provide more granular context to your links. You can create links that include the series name or even the value under the cursor.

For each data link, you'll set the following options:

- **Title**
- **URL**
- **Open in new tab**

To learn more, refer to [Configure data links](../../configure-data-links/).
