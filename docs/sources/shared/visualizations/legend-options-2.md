When the legend option is enabled it can show either the value mappings or the threshold brackets. To show the value mappings in the legend, it's important that the **Color scheme** as referenced in [Color scheme][] is set to **Single color** or **Classic palette**. To see the threshold brackets in the legend set the **Color scheme** to **From thresholds**.

For more information about the legend, refer to [Configure a legend](../configure-legend/).

### Visibility

### Mode

- **List -** Displays the legend as a list. This is a default display mode of the legend.
- **Table -** Displays the legend as a table.

### Placement

- **Bottom -** Below the graph.
- **Right -** To the right of the graph.

#### Width

Control how wide the legend is when placed on the right side of the visualization. This option is only displayed if you set the legend placement to **Right**.
