### Tooltip mode

When you hover your cursor over the visualization, Grafana can display tooltips. Choose how tooltips behave.

- **Single -** The hover tooltip shows only a single series, the one that you are hovering over on the visualization.
- **All -** The hover tooltip shows all series in the visualization. Grafana highlights the series that you are hovering over in bold in the series list in the tooltip.
- **Hidden -** Do not display the tooltip when you interact with the visualization.

Use an override to hide individual series from the tooltip.

### Values sort order

When you set the **Tooltip mode** to **All**, the **Values sort order** option is displayed. This option controls the order in which values are listed in a tooltip. Choose from the following:

- **None** - Grafana automatically sorts the values displayed in a tooltip.
- **Ascending** - Values in the tooltip are listed from smallest to largest.
- **Descending** - Values in the tooltip are listed from largest to smallest.

### Max height

Set the maximum height of the tooltip box. The default is 600 pixels.
