In addition to field overrides, value mapping is a technique you can use to change how data appears in a visualization.

For each value mapping, you'll set the following options:

- **Condition** - Choose what is mapped to the display text and (optionally) color:
  - **Value** - Specific values
  - **Range** - Numerical ranges
  - **Regex** - Regular expressions
  - **Special** - Special values like `Null`, `NaN` (not a number), or boolean values like `true` and `false`
- **Display text**
- **Color** (Optional)

To learn more, refer to [Configure value mappings](../../configure-value-mappings/).
