Using Trace to profiles, you can use Grafanaâ€™s ability to correlate different signals by adding the functionality to link between traces and profiles.

**Trace to profiles** lets you link your Grafana Pyroscope data source to tracing data.
When configured, this connection lets you run queries from a trace span into the profile data.

To use tract to profiles, you must have a configured Grafana Pyroscope data source.

1. Select the Pyroscope data source from the **Data source** drop-down.
1. Optional: Choose any tags that will be used in the query. If left blank. the default values of `service.name` and `service.namespace` are used.
1. Select one or more profile types to use in the query. Select the drop-down and choose options from the menu.
1. Optional: Toggle **Use custom query** to enter a custom query. You can interpolate the configured tags using the `$__tags` keyword.
1. Select **Save and Test**.

To use trace to profile, navigate to **Explore** and query a trace. Each span now links to your queries. Clicking a link runs the query in a split panel. If tags are configured, Grafana dynamically inserts the span attribute values into the query. The query runs over the time range currently selected in **Explore**.
