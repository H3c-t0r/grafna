# Field configuration

This page explains what field configurations and field overrides in Grafana are and how to use them.

> **Note:** This documentation refers to a Grafana 7.0 beta feature. This documentation will be frequently updated to reflect updates to the feature, and it will probably be broken into smaller sections when the feature moves out of beta.
