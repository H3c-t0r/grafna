# Panel options

Panel options are common to all panels. They are basic options to add information and clarity to your panels. Fields are described below.

## Title

Text entered in this field is displayed at the top of your panel in the panel editor and in the dashboard.

## Description

Text entered in this field is displayed in a tooltip in the upper left corner of the panel. Write a description of the panel and the data you are displaying. Pretend you are explaining it to a new user six months from now, when it is no longer fresh in your mind. Future editors (possibly yourself) will thank you.
