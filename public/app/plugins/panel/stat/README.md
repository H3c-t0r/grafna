# Stat Panel - Native Plugin

The Stat Panel is **included** with Grafana.

The Stat Panel allows you to show the one main summary stat of a SINGLE series. It reduces the series into a single number (by looking at the max, min, average, or sum of values in the series). Stat also provides thresholds to color the stat or the Panel background. It can also translate the single number into a text value, and show a sparkline summary of the series.

The Stat Panel is a replacement for the Singlestat Panel, which was deprecated in Grafana v7.0 and removed after Grafana v8.4. Learn more about the now removed Singlestat Panel [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v8.4/visualizations/stat-panel/).
