# Stat panel - Native Plugin

The Stat panel is **included** with Grafana.

TThe Stat panel visualization shows a one large stat value with an optional graph sparkline. You can control the background or value color using thresholds.

By default, the Stat panel displays one of the following:

- Just the value for a single series or field.
- Both the value and name for multiple series or fields.

You can use the Text mode to control whether the text is displayed or not.

The Stat panel is a replacement for the Singlestat panel, which was deprecated in Grafana v7.0 and removed after Grafana v8.4. Learn more about the now removed Singlestat panel [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v8.4/visualizations/stat-panel/).
