Each transformation allows you to add one new field.\n\n  - **Mode** - Select a mode:\n    - **Reduce row** - Apply selected calculation on each row of selected fields independently.\n    - **Binary operation** - Apply basic binary operations (for example, sum or multiply) on values in a single row from two selected fields.\n    - **Unary operation** - Apply basic unary operations on values in a single row from a selected field. The available operations are:\n      - **Absolute value (abs)** - Returns the absolute value of a given expression. It represents its distance from zero as a positive number.\n      - **Natural exponential (exp)** - Returns _e_ raised to the power of a given expression.\n      - **Natural logarithm (ln)** - Returns the natural logarithm of a given expression.\n      - **Floor (floor)** - Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given expression.\n      - **Ceiling (ceil)** - Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given expression.\n    - **Cumulative functions** - Apply functions on the current row and all preceding rows.\n      - **Total** - Calculates the cumulative total up to and including the current row.\n      - **Mean** - Calculates the mean up to and including the current row.\n    - **Window functions** - Apply window functions. The window can either be **trailing** or **centered**.\n      With a trailing window the current row will be the last row in the window. \n      With a centered window the window will be centered on the current row. \n      For even window sizes, the window will be centered between the current row, and the previous row. \n      - **Mean** - Calculates the moving mean or running average.\n      - **Stddev** - Calculates the moving standard deviation.\n      - **Variance** - Calculates the moving variance.\n    - **Row index** - Insert a field with the row index.\n  - **Field name** - Select the names of fields you want to use in the calculation for the new field.\n  - **Calculation** - If you select **Reduce row** mode, then the **Calculation** field appears. Click in the field to see a list of calculation choices you can use to create the new field. For information about available calculations, refer to [Calculation types][].\n  - **Operation** - If you select **Binary operation** or **Unary operation** mode, then the **Operation** fields appear. These fields allow you to apply basic math operations on values in a single row from selected fields. You can also use numerical values for binary operations.\n  - **As percentile** - If you select **Row index** mode, then the **As percentile** switch appears. This switch allows you to transform the row index as a percentage of the total number of rows.\n  - **Alias** - (Optional) Enter the name of your new field. If you leave this blank, then the field will be named to match the calculation.\n  - **Replace all fields** - (Optional) Select this option if you want to hide all other fields and display only your calculated field in the visualization.\n  \n  > **Note:** **Cumulative functions** and **Window functions** modes are experimental features.

This table lists all fields found in the data returned by the config query, along with **Use as** and **Select** options. It provides control over mapping fields to config properties, and for multiple rows, it allows you to choose which value to select.\n\n  #### Example\n\n  Input[0] (From query: A, name: ServerA)\n\n  | Time          | Value |\n  | ------------- | ----- |\n  | 1626178119127 | 10    |\n  | 1626178119129 | 30    |\n\n  Input[1] (From query: B)\n\n  | Time          | Value |\n  | ------------- | ----- |\n  | 1626178119127 | 100   |\n  | 1626178119129 | 100   |\n\n  Output (Same as Input[0] but now with config on the Value field)\n\n  | Time          | Value (config: Max=100) |\n  | ------------- | ----------------------- |\n  | 1626178119127 | 10                      |\n  | 1626178119129 | 30                      |\n\n  Each row in the source data becomes a separate field.

If set, they are used by the visualization instead of any options manually configured in the panel editor options pane.\n\n  #### Value mappings\n\n  You can also transform a query result into value mappings. With this option, every row in the configuration query result defines a single value mapping row. See the following example.\n\n  Config query result:\n\n  | Value | Text   | Color |\n  | ----- | ------ | ----- |\n  | L     | Low    | blue  |\n  | M     | Medium | green |\n  | H     | High   | red   |\n\n  In the field mapping specify:\n\n  | Field | Use as                  | Select     |\n  | ----- | ----------------------- | ---------- |\n  | Value | Value mappings / Value  | All values |\n  | Text  | Value mappings / Text   | All values |\n  | Color | Value mappings / Ciolor | All values |\n\n  Grafana builds value mappings from your query result and applies them to the real data query results. You should see values being mapped and colored according to the config query results.\n  ";

To do so, add that condition to the following configuration:\n\n  - Filter type: 'Include' rows that 'Match All' conditions\n  - Condition 1: Rows where 'Temperature' matches 'Lower' than '30'\n  - Condition 2: Rows where 'Altitude' matches 'Greater' than '100'\n\n  When you have more than one condition, you can choose if you want the action (include/exclude) to be applied on rows that **Match all** conditions or **Match any** of the conditions you added.\n\n  In the example above, we chose **Match all** because we wanted to include the rows that have a temperature lower than 30\u00B0C *AND* an altitude higher than 100. If we wanted to include the rows that have a temperature lower than 30\u00B0C *OR* an altitude higher than 100 instead, then we would select **Match any**. This would include the first row in the original data, which has a temperature of 32\u00B0C (does not match the first condition) but an altitude of 101 (which matches the second condition), so it is included.\n\n  Conditions that are invalid or incompletely configured are ignored.\n\n  This versatile data filtering transformation lets you to selectively include or exclude data points based on specific conditions.

First you specify one or multiple fields to group the data by. This will group all the same values of those fields together, as if you sorted them. For instance if we group by the Server ID field, then it would group the data this way:\n\n  | Time                | Server ID      | CPU Temperature | Server Status |\n  | ------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------- |\n  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | **server 1**   | 80              | Shutdown      |\n  | 2020-07-07 09:28:06 | **server 1**   | 80              | OK            |\n  | 2020-07-07 09:23:07 | **server 1**   | 86              | OK            |\n  | 2020-07-07 10:32:20 | server 2       | 90              | Overload      |\n  | 2020-07-07 09:30:05 | server 2       | 88              | OK            |\n  | 2020-07-07 09:25:05 | server 2       | 88              | OK            |\n  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | **_server 3_** | 62              | OK            |\n  | 2020-07-07 10:31:22 | **_server 3_** | 55              | OK            |\n  | 2020-07-07 09:30:57 | **_server 3_** | 62              | Rebooting     |\n\n  All rows with the same value of Server ID are grouped together.\n\n  After choosing which field you want to group your data by, you can add various calculations on the other fields, and apply the calculation to each group of rows. For instance, we could want to calculate the average CPU temperature for each of those servers. So we can add the _mean_ calculation applied on the CPU Temperature field to get the following:\n\n  | Server ID | CPU Temperature (mean) |\n  | --------- | ---------------------- |\n  | server 1  | 82                     |\n  | server 2  | 88.6                   |\n  | server 3  | 59.6                   |\n\n  And we can add more than one calculation. For instance:\n\n  - For field Time, we can calculate the _Last_ value, to know when the last data point was received for each server\n  - For field Server Status, we can calculate the _Last_ value to know what is the last state value for each server\n  - For field Temperature, we can also calculate the _Last_ value to know what is the latest monitored temperature for each server\n\n  We would then get:\n\n  | Server ID | CPU Temperature (mean) | CPU Temperature (last) | Time (last)         | Server Status (last) |\n  | --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |\n  | server 1  | 82                     | 80                     | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | Shutdown             |\n  | server 2  | 88.6                   | 90                     | 2020-07-07 10:32:20 | Overload             |\n  | server 3  | 59.6                   | 62                     | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | OK                   |\n\n  This transformation allows you to extract essential information from your time series and present it conveniently.\n  ";
