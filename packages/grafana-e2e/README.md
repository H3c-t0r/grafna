# Grafana End-to-End Test library

> [!CAUTION]
> This package is deprecated.
> I you'd like to write end-to-end tests for a Grafana plugin (core or external), use the [`@grafana/plugin-e2e`](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/e2e-test-a-plugin/introduction) package. For end-to-end testing non-plugin related core features, you can add your Cypress tests [here](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/tree/main/e2e).
