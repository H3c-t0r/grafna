# Stack

Stack is a component for doing simple layouts, either vertically or horizontally.

### Usage

#### When to use

Use the Stack component when you need to arrange elements in a linear format, either vertically or horizontally. It's particularly useful when you want to maintain consistent spacing between items.

Use the Stack component when:

- You need a simple way to stack elements with predictable spacing.
- You want to ensure responsive behavior with consistent alignment.

#### When not to use

Use the `Grid` component instead for these use cases:

- **Intricate Layouts:** Grids are ideal for complex dashboard and magazine-style designs with rows and columns.
- **Structured Grid:** Use Grids when items need to span multiple rows/columns, creating structured layouts.

Use the `Flex` component instead for these use cases:

- **Centering:** Perfect for centering elements both vertically and horizontally.
- **Dynamic Order:** Easily reorder elements for responsive layouts without changing code.
