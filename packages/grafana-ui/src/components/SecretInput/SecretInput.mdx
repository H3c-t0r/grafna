# Secret Input

Used for secret/password input it has 2 states **_configured_** and **_not configured_**.

- If configured it will not show its contents and adds a reset button that will
  clear the input and makes it accessible.
- In non configured state it behaves like normal text input.

This is used for passwords or anything that is encrypted on the server and is
later returned encrypted to the user (like datasource passwords).

### Usage

```tsx
import {SecretInput} from '@grafana/ui';

<SecretInput
  value={...}
  isConfigured={...}
  onChange={...}
  onReset={...}
/>
```

<Props of={SecretInput} />
