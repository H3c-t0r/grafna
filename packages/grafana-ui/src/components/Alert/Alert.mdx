# Alert

An alert displays an important message in a way that attracts the user's attention without interrupting the user's task.

## Behaviors

1. **Persistent**: They are usually urgent and intrusive, require immediate attention and require action to be dismissed.
2. **Passive**: Are informational, report a system issue that does not require any action by users.

## Types

Within Grafana, we have three different types of alerts and they can be used depending on the context and content.

1. **[Inline](#alertInline)**:
   - To notify users of the status of an action. They appear at the top or bottom of the main content area
   - Passive or Persistent
2. **[Toast](#alertToast)**:
   - These temporary window elements are used to display short messages; they appear at the top-right corner of the screen and can be dismissed by clicking the [x] or it will disappear after a few seconds
   - Passive
3. **[Banner](#alertBanner)**:(?)
   - It will remain until the user rejects it or until the status that triggered the banner is resolved
   - Persistent

## Message Type

1. **Informational**
   - Usage: Provide information to users, and don’t interrupt any current actions
   - Action: Do not require immediate action and can be dismissed by a user clicking the [X] or passively display until the display timer expires
   - Color: Blue background
   - Icon: Info-circle
2. **Success**
   - Usage: When any action is successful, it is confirmed when a task is completed as expected
   - Action: Typically do not require further action and can be dismissed automatically or persist in a nonintrusive manner
   - Color: Green background
   - Icon: Check
3. **Warning**
   - Usage: Informing users that an action is undesirable
   - Action: Often persists until users have taken action to dismiss the notification or taken steps to resolve the issue
   - Color: Yellow background
   - Icon: Exclamation-triangle
4. **Error**
   - Usage: When an action doesn't happen as expected, usually something has failed and the user is expected to take action
   - Action: Always persists until the user has taken steps to remedy the issue that triggered the notification
   - Color: Red background
   - Icon: Exclamation-triangle

### Main elements

- Icon Status: represent the importance of the message through the color and icon for each status.

- Alert Copy/Title: should be explicit, clear and short that explain the most important part of the information.

- Details: precise description for the notification, telling users what they need to do.

- Button and text links: only persistent notifications should contain text links or buttons.

- Close Icon: appears when the notification can be dismissed by the user.

## Usage

### <a name="alertInline"/>Inline Banner

Inline Banners are task-oriented alerts that notify users of the status of an action or system. These alerts are contextual — appearing above or below main content areas — allowing users to address issues or to read messages quickly.

#### Do's

    - Use the appropriate status for the message (info/success/warning/error).
    - Use plain, simple language for the messages to ensure users understand them and know how to address them.
    - Focus on notifications if they are relevant to the users' current workflow and should be addressed immediately.

#### Don'ts

    - Do not use Primary calls to actions.
    - Do not hide other content with inline notifications.
    - Do not repeat the alert copy/title on the details message.

#### When to use

    - To inform at that time how to continue a task in which users must perform an action.
    - To provide some options for users to take action.
    - To explain in detail the reasons why something can’t be done by users.

#### Placement

    - Should be placed immediately above or below the related element.

```jsx
<Alert title={title} severity={severity} buttonContent={buttonContent} onRemove={onRemove}>
  <VerticalGroup>
    <div>Child content that includes some alert details, like maybe what actually happened.</div>
  </VerticalGroup>
</Alert>
```

### <a name="alertToast"/>Toast

Toast notifications are short messages that appear in the top-right corner of the page and are automatically hidden after a certain amount of time – they provide live notifications, without interrupting the user experience or requiring an action to be taken.

#### Do's

    - Use this component using `AppEvents` and `getAppEvents()`.
    - Show the `Toast` publishing the `appEvent` with the proper type and payload needed.

```jsx
import { AppEvents } from '@grafana/data';
import { getAppEvents } from '@grafana/runtime';

const appEvents = getAppEvents();
appEvents.publish({
  type: AppEvents.alertSuccess.name,
  payload: [text + ': ' + resp.status + ' (' + resp.statusText + ')'],
});
```

#### Don'ts

    - Do not use this component straightfordward.

#### When to use

    - To convey general confirmation or non-critical actions.
    - Immediately after an event is taken, such as a permission is updated and some Dashboards are imported or deleted.
    - Use cases statuses
        - *Success*: When any action is successful, it is confirmed when a task is completed as expected.
        - *Warning*: It is used to report a current status that users should be aware of or that could have serious consequences.
        - *Error*: Inform users of an error, and sometimes provide more information about how to fix the error.

#### Placement

    - Slide in and out from the top right corner of the page.


```jsx
<Alert title={title} severity={severity} onRemove={onRemove} elevated>
  <VerticalGroup>
    <div>Child content that includes some alert details, like maybe what actually happened.</div>
  </VerticalGroup>
</Alert>
```
