# Flex

The Flex Component aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container and
the decision to create it is to ensure consistency in design across Grafana.

### Usage

#### When to use

Use when in need to align components and small parts of the application. Use as parent container to wrap elements that
you wish to align in a certain way.

#### When not to use

When you need to lay out bigger parts of the application or when you want to create page lay out.

### Variants

### Dos

    * to display the direction of the elements
    * to set the elements to wrap
    * to align items (center, vertically or horizontally)

### Don'ts

    * for complex grid lay outs with various rows and columns
    * bidirectional lay outs
    * complex nesting
    * equal height columns

### Props

<ArgTypes of={Flex} />
