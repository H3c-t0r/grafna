# RadioButtonGroup

`RadioButtonGroup` is used to select a single value from multiple mutually exclusive options.

### When to use

Use `RadioButtonGroup` for mutually exclusive selections if there are up to four options available. This is because the `RadioButtonGroup` cannot have more than one row and should still accommodate small resolutions. For a mutually exclusive selection of more than four options, use `Select` component.

Like `Checkbox`, `RadioButtonGroup` only triggers changes on sending a form. Furthermore, radio buttons can only exist in this group. If you want one single option, or if you want your component to trigger changes immediately, it's better to use `Switch` instead. To offer multiple choices within the same group or context which are not mutually exclusive, use `Checkbox` instead.

### Usage

```jsx
import { Forms } from '@grafana/ui';

<Forms.RadioButtonGroup options={...} value={...} onChange={...} />
```

#### Disabling options

To disable some options pass those options to the `RadioButtonGroup` via `disabledOptions` property:

```jsx

const options = [
  { label: 'Prometheus', value: 'prometheus' },
  { label: 'Graphite', value: 'graphite' },
  { label: 'Elastic', value: 'elastic' },
  { label: 'InfluxDB', value: 'influx' },
];

const disabledOptions = ['prometheus', 'elastic'];


<Forms.RadioButtonGroup
  options={options}
  disabledOptions={disabledOptions}
  value={...}
  onChange={...}
/>
```

<Props of={RadioButtonGroup} />
